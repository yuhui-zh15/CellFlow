## üîÆ Abstract

Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects‚Äîa major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research.

**Overview of CellFlux.**
(a) Objective. CellFlux aims to predict changes in cell morphology induced by chemical or gene perturbations in silico. In this example, the perturbation effect reduces the nuclear size. 
(b) Data. The dataset includes images from high-content screening experiments, where chemical or genetic perturbations are applied to target wells, alongside control wells without perturbations. Control wells provide prior information to contrast with target images, enabling the identification of true perturbation effects (e.g., reduced nucleus size) while calibrating non-perturbation artifacts such as batch effects‚Äîsystematic biases unrelated to the perturbation (e.g., variations in color intensity). 
(c) Problem formulation. We formulate the task as a distribution-to-distribution problem (many-to-many mapping), where the source distribution consists of control images, and the target distribution contains perturbed images within the same batch. 
(d) Flow matching. CellFlux employs flow matching, a state-of-the-art generative approach for distribution-to-distribution problems. It learns a neural network to approximate a velocity field, continuously transforming the source distribution into the target by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). 
(e) Results. CellFlux significantly outperforms baselines in image generation quality, achieving lower Fr¬¥echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher classification accuracy for mode-of-action (MoA) predictions.
